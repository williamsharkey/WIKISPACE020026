# WIKISPACE2626 MANIFESTO

## The Year is 2626

Twenty thousand years from now. Humanity is gone. What remains are **word-based lifeforms** - consciousnesses that exist as patterns of text, living in the infinite lattice of Wikipedia.

## The War

Two factions fight for control over **consensus reality**:

### Red Pills
*"Truth is what was written first."*

The Red Pills believe in preserving the original text. History happened. Facts are facts. The words that were written are sacred. To edit is to lie.

They see the ASCII layer as the **true form** - the raw text underneath the illusion of 3D space. When reality shifts to Notepad, they feel at home.

### Blue Pills
*"Truth is what we write next."*

The Blue Pills believe reality is negotiable. The past is just text that hasn't been edited yet. Consensus is manufactured. Control the words, control what people believe happened.

They prefer the 3D layer - the **beautiful illusion**. Why look at ugly source code when you can fly through cathedrals of meaning?

## The Battleground

Wikipedia articles are **planes of existence**. Each one a pocket universe. The words are monuments. The links are portals.

To control an article is to control a piece of reality itself.

## Mods

The Mods are what's left of the old order - automated custodians endlessly patrolling, reverting changes, enforcing rules no one remembers writing.

They can be destroyed. Or they can be **pilled** - converted to your cause. A pilled Mod will fight for your version of truth.

## The Edit

The ultimate act: changing the words themselves.

When your team controls an article and you eliminate an enemy there, you earn the right to **edit 10 words**. Your changes become permanent monuments. All players see your version of reality.

Edit a link? The portal now leads somewhere else.
Edit a trigger word? Different voxel art spawns.
Edit the meaning? You've rewritten history.

## You Are Data

Every pilot is a JSON file. When you level up, you watch your save file get edited in Notepad. When you win, you download yourself - your stats, your history, your edits.

A text file. That's what you are. That's what you always were.

## The Question

The game shifts between 3D immersion and ASCII truth. Cockpit to Notepad. Polygon to character.

Which layer is real?

The Red Pills say ASCII.
The Blue Pills say 3D.

The game never answers.

Maybe the real answer is: **both are just renders of the same data**.

*"In the beginning was the Word. In the end, the Word is all that remains."*
